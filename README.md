## üö™ Description

This Python Monty Hall Simulation allows you to explore the counterintuitive probabilities of the Monty Hall problem. </br>
The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. The player is presented with three doors. Behind one door is a car, and behind the other two are goats. After the player makes an initial choice, the host (Monty Hall) opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat. The player is then given the option to stick with their original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door. </br>Surprisingly, the probability of winning is higher when switching doors.
